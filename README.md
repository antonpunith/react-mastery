## 📚 Concepts Covered

### 🔥 Hooks

#### State Hooks

- **useState**: Declares a state variable and allows direct updates.
- **useReducer**: Manages more complex state logic using a reducer function.

#### Context Hooks

- **useContext**: Reads and subscribes to context, providing a way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.

#### Ref Hooks

- **useRef**: Creates a mutable reference that can hold any value — often used to interact directly with DOM elements.
- **useImperativeHandle**: Customizes the ref exposed by your component — used for advanced scenarios.

#### Effect Hooks

- **useEffect**: Connects a component to external systems, running side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

#### Performance Hooks

- **useMemo**: Optimizes performance by caching the result of expensive calculations.
- **useCallback**: Returns a memoized version of a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## 🏗️ What's next?

- **Component Patterns**: HOCs, Render Props, and Compound Components.
- **State Management**: Context API, Redux, and Zustand.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests using React Testing Library and Jest.
- **Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization.
- **Advanced Topics**: Concurrent React, Suspense, and Server Components.
