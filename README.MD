# Learn React

This repository is to review all of the React Js concepts.



## Hooks
### State Hooks
* **useState** declares a state variable that you can update directly.
* **useReducer** declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.

### Context Hooks
* **useContext** reads and subscribes to a context.

### Ref Hooks
* **useRef** declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often itâ€™s used to hold a DOM node.
* **useImperativeHandle** lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.

### Effect Hooks
* useEffect connects a component to an external system.

### Performance Hooks
* **useMemo** lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
* **useCallback** lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
